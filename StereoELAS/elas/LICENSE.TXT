Libelas (LIBrary for Efficient LArge-scale Stereo matching) is a cross-platfrom C++
library with MATLAB wrappers for computing disparity maps of large images. Input
is a rectified greyscale stereo image pair of same size. Output are the corresponding
disparity maps.

If you distribute a software that uses libelas, you have to distribute it under GPL
with the source code. Another option is to contact us to purchase a commercial license.
