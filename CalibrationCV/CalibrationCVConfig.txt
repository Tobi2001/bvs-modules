# Spaces and tabs are ignored (except inside '' and "") and everything is case

# This is a section/configuration header.
# It can be used to create 'configurations' of your module, simply by creating
# various sections with different options belonging to them. These are selected
# by using them as a uniqueID in BVSConfig.txt when adding modules to the
# system (if you use 'id + ".option"' to retrieve them), e.g.
# modules += uniqueID(CalibrationCV)...
