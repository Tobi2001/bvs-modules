# short syntax:

# [section]
# option = value
#
# Spaces and tabs are ignored (except inside '' and "") and everything is case
# insensitive. For more information on syntax as well as further capabilities,
# please see 'libbvs/include/bvs/config.h' or 'DOXYGEN:Classes->BVS::Config'.

# This is a section/configuration header.
# It can be used to create 'configurations' of your module, simply by creating
# various sections with different options belonging to them. These are selected
# by using them as a uniqueID in BVSConfig.txt when adding modules to the
# system (if you use 'id + ".option"' to retrieve them), e.g.
# modules += uniqueID(CaptureCV)...
